### Installation

1. Move `Linen.yml` to any place you'd like.
2. In `alacritty.yml`, at the top of the document, import the colorscheme by specifying its path, _for example_:

```
import:
  - /home/example/.config/alacritty/themes/Linen.yml
```

3. Make sure there aren't any other instances of `color` mentioned in `alacritty.yml`, if there are, comment them out.

That's it, enjoy!
